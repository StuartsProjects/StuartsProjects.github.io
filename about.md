## About me

Since retiring in July 2017, I can now do stuff that interests me and that I did not have time for when working full time. My main interests are in testing the capability of **LoRa®** and designing low cost easy build LoRa® devices. 

I studied Radio Television and Electronics at Llandaff Technical College in Cardiff from 1977 to 1980. 

From 1980 I worked as a Microprocessor design engineer at Gowerpoint Manufacturing in Hadfield road, Cardiff. This company were one of the very early adopters of the use of Microprocessors in amusement machines.  

In 1983 I joined AB Electronics in Abercarn and was responsible for the electronics aspects of the manufacture of BBC Microcomputers. When the first ARM machine in the World (the Acorn Archimedes) came into the lab for the company to build, we all thought 'gosh it's fast'.

Made redundant in 1993 I set up my own company, SR Networks, installing computer systems and networks for local Cardiff companies. 

From 2005 I worked as a Novell Engineer contractor, till in 2008 I was employed by Fujitsu Services who at the time had the contract to support the DVLA’s computer systems. In 2015 the DVLA brought their computer network support in-house and I was then a civil servant. 

I have always had a interest in Electronics, originally as a career, but still maintained an active interest as a hobby until I retired. 

In 2012 I was asked to provide assistance for an Educational based satellite project being run by Morehead University in America. The objective of the project was to demonstrate that very small and low cost satellites were practical and could form part of the School\College curriculum. 

Myself and two colleagues in the US were invited to submit a satellite for launch and $50SAT (as we called it) was put into Earth orbit on 21st November 2013. The design of $50SAT was minimalist on purpose and despite it's very low build cost of £125 it operated successfully in orbit for 20 months. A lot was learned about the conditions that such small satellites, $50SAT weighed 206grams, must endure in orbit. 

If the launch of $50SAT had been 6 months later, then it is likely we would have been able to take advantage of the new LoRa® devices that had been recently released by Semtech. I began experimenting with LoRa® in mid 2014 and did some of the early work that established the very long range capabilities of LoRa®. I designed high altitude balloon trackers and using low cost foil party balloons was able to demonstrate that when used at even the low licence exempt powers (10mW), LoRa® was capable of more than 250km range.

At the end of 2018 I started looking at the SX1280 2.4Ghz LoRa® devices and eventually produced a Arduino library for the devices that included the distance measuring (ranging) capability of the SX1280. Used as a tracker in a high altitude balloon flight a distance of 89km was achieved.
