Had a great time at this event, lots of really interesting stuff and very well organised. We all had these badges, wonder if you could use it as a tracker ?

I was at EMF giving a talk on a previous project, $50SAT, you can see the presentation here on You Tube

There is a small section on LoRa at the end. It would be very interesting to see someone try a LoRa device from low Earth orbit, and I have received some interest from a ‘Space Agency’. There might be issues at apogee with Doppler, but if not the digital communications ought to have far greater range than we had with the RFM22B on $50SAT. One day maybe.
