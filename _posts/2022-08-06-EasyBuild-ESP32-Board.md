For some time I have wanted an easy to put together portable and hand held LoRa receiver that would have enough resources to be used for receiving files and images over LoRa. The board needed an SD card and a small display.

To make the board multi purpose there should be connectors for adding external sensors or a GPS. It would be useful for the board to have Bluetooth and WiFi capability.

So in summary the board needed;

1. To be easy to put together, avoiding the need for SMT assembly.
1. A micro controller with plenty of memory.
1. A Mikrobus compatible socket so a wide range of LoRa or Click boards could be used.
1. An SD card holder.
1. A small OLED display.
1. Preferably Bluetooth and WiFi capability.
1. Connections for a battery pack. 
1. Some switches.
1. Neopixel LEDs for status indications.

The micro controller I decided on was the NodeMCU ESP32, this has plenty of memory, is ready built and low cost. It comes with 0.1" pins for mounting so fitting it to a board is easy. More I\O pins would have been useful, but after a bit of planning I came up with a workable design, here is a picture of the assembled prototype, I am calling it the EasyBuildESP32;

</p>
<br>

The NodeMCU is offset from the top of the board for a reason. One significant concern for a bench or hand held device was leaving the somewhat fragile USB connection permanently connected. I have lost modules because after a while the USB PCB connector can snap off. So for this board I arranged it so that the USB cable could be secured to the board with a spacer and a tie wrap, see the idea below;

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img width="450"  src="/images/NodeMCU_Shield_2.jpg">
</p>
<br>
 

You don't have to secure the USB cable this way, but if your using the board in portable mode and powering it with a USB power bank plugged into the NodeMCU, then securing the USB cable might be a good idea. Think what might happen if you drop the power bank.

The board has connectors for;

1. Mikrobus compatible plug in boards.
1. Battery pack.
1. I2C external sensors.
1. I2C MPR121 3X4 Touch Keypad.
1. GPS.
1. USB to Serial adapter for serial file uploads to a PC.
 
I do sell breadboard friendly boards for LoRa devices that can plug into the Mikrobus compatible socket on the EasyBuildESP32 and those for RFM9x and DRF127x UHF devices can be assembled with header pins rather than SMT soldering. You can get these compatible LoRa boards here; [**Tindie Store**](https://www.tindie.com/stores/stuartsprojects/). 


##Direct fit of RFM9x or SX1280 LoRa devices. 

This first off design of the EasyBuildESP32 has the SMT pads to accept an RFM9x LoRa device direct on the front side and a NiceRF SX1280 (2.4Ghz) LoRa device on the rear. There are connections for an edge SMA antenna socket or a simple wire antenna. 

To enable both devices to share the same antenna socket there is a track to be cut depending on which module you have. If you are using an RFM9x then cut the track at 'B' which is a square pad near the centre of the SMA antenna socket. The easiest way to cut the track is to drill a hole (about 1mm diameter) at point 'B'. If your fitting a SX1280 on the board rear, then cut the track at point 'A' which is the round pad, again the easiest way to do this is to drill a 1mm hole.

##Parts



#### Mikrobus compatible socket

There are holes provide on the NodeMCU board to allow the fitting of an extended Mikrobus socket. A standard Mikrobus socket has two rows of 8 pins on a 0.1" matrix. The bottom two sets of 8 pins in the picture below of the Mikrobus compatible socket on the EasyBuildESP32 board are for a standard Mikrobus plug in board.  Some of the LoRa boards I have designed need extra pins for the LoRa devices DIOX connections so two extra pins were added to the top on each side while keeping the overall size of the Mikrobus PCB the same. 


<br>
<p align="center">

</p>
<br>


Mikroelectronika produce a wide range of Click boards, see here;

[**Mikroelectronika Click boards**](https://www.mikroe.com/click)

The Click boards using 3.3V logic should be compatible with the EasyBuildESP32 board, fit the click board in the bottom 8 pins of the boards Mikrobus socket, the bottom of the socket is marked with a triangle in white on the PCB. 

For ease of use, I normally fit two 10 pin 0.1" sockets for the Mikrobus boards, its then easy to swap between different modules. You can however omit the sockets and solder the Mikrobus boards in direct which does make them very low profile on the PCB. 

The Mikrobus boards on my [**Tindie Store**](https://www.tindie.com/stores/stuartsprojects/) are also suitable for use on breadboards.    


#### microSD card holders

Please note that for the microSD card holders, a holder that is designed for use on 5V logic level Arduinos **should not be used on this board** it will mess up the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus. Use a microSD card holder type that has no regulator or logic level converters. The microSD card holders I used for the EasyBuildESP32 are pictured below, pin in hole type on the left, SMT type on the right;

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img width="450"  src="/images/NodeMCU_Shield_4.jpg">
</p>
<br>

The microSD card is used on the EasyBuildESP32 in MMC (Multi Media Card)mode. This uses a separate interface on the ESP32 that is dedicated to driving a microSD card in MMC mode. The SD card card could have been driven in SPI mode and then it would share pins with the LoRa device which also runs in SPI mode. However whilst sharing the SPI bus between SD cards and LoRa devices works reliably on some Arduino cores, such as the Arduino DUE and the cores for ATmega328P and ATmega1284P, its not very reliable on the ESP32, after some time the microSD card stops responding. 

Driving the microSD card in MMC mode seems to be a lot more reliable.

Please note that its very likely that you wont be able to upload programs to the NodeMCU if there is an SD card in the slot, since the presence of a card impacts the logic level on pin GPIO2. 


#### OLED display connections. 

The I2C (Inter integrated circuit) OLED displays can use different connections for VDD and GND. See the PCB connections for 'DISP' below. Some displays will be connected, left to right GND,VCC,SCL,SDA and some displays will be VCC,GND,SCL,SDA. 

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img width="450"  src="/images/NodeMCU_Shield_7.jpg">
</p>
<br>

LK7 allows you to select VCC or GND for pin 1 of the DISP connector. LK6 allows you to select VCC or GND for pin 2 of the DISP connector. Make the links and then check with a multimeter that the polarity of the voltage on pins 1 and 2 of the DISP connector are correct for your display. 

Note that the NodeMCU is 3.3V logic level and supply, so use the correct version of the OLED, some are for 5V operation. In the picture below the left display is for 3.3V operation, so the one you need, the display on the right is a 5V display and is not the right type for this board, it might not work very well. Note that 5V type has a small regulator fitted, its marked U2 on the right display.

<br>


#### Switches

There are 4 sets of push button switches used, SW1 to SW4. There is the option of fitting the type of push button that comes in different button lengths (the SWxB parts), or you can use the small rectangular low profile type (the SWxA parts), your choice. See picture A type switches on the left, B type switches on the right.

<br>

#### Resistors 

There are a number of resistor pull ups that can be fitted for the MMC_SD pins. In most cases they are not needed but they were designed into place on a just in case basis. In the list of parts below if a resistor is normally not needed then its mentioned. 

Use standard, easy to get, 1/4 watt resistors or the smaller 1/6 watt or 1/8 watt types.

#### Part voltage ratings.

The maximum voltage for an external supply is likely going to be 7.5V, from 5 Alkaline batteries. Thus capacitors and other components should have a voltage rating of 10V or higher. 



## List of parts

1. ANT1  SMA edge socket If you fitted an RFM9X or SX1280 direct to the PCB then this is the socket for the antenna, or you can solder a wire direct to the centre pin. Not needed if your using a plug in Mikrobus type LoRa board.
  
1. BAT  SCREWTERMINAL 2WAY 0.1 inch, for the external battery. Use the screw terminal if you have one or a 0.1" angled header or solder wires direct.
     
1. BATHOLDER  AA_X_5_DEFAULT The battery holder that can be stuck on the back of the PCB. Four AA Alkalines is a marginal supply for the board. When the batteries are new then you have a 6V supply. But around 50% of the way through the battery life the supply will start going below 4.8V. Five AA alkalines, or NiMh rechargeables might be a better choice.  

1. C1  100nF  Medium ceramic disk You need to fit this part

1. C3  220uF - 1000uF   An optional electrolytic capacitor  for smoothing which may improve board stability if there are problems when the WiFi or Bluetooth are used. Can be up to 8mm diameter. Its on VCC at 3.3V so need only be a 6.3V part. 

1. C4  47uF  2mm spacing electrolytic Only needed if you want to power the neopixels from the external battery supply

1. C5  100nF  Medium ceramic disk Only needed if you want to power the neopixels from the external battery supply

1. LK4  2 Pin 0.1” header Fit this wire link only if you want the VIN from the NodeMCU connected to the Mikrobus socket. If the external battery is connected this voltage will be about 300mV less than the battery voltage. If the NodeMCU is being powered from the USB connector the voltage here will be about 4.7v. Not needed for the LoRa boards shown here.   

1. LK5  2 Pin 0.1” header Fit if you want to bypass neopixels L3 and L4 when using the external connector CONE.

## EasyBoardESP32 build order

Its easiest to describe the build order by giving the parts needed, as a minimum, to make each example sketch above work. Please note that its very likely that you wont be able to upload programs to the NodeMCU if there is an SD card in the slot, since the presence of a card impacts the logic level on pin GPIO2.

**1\_LED\_Blink**. Fit the NodeMCU and then if your not going to use the neopixels, fit LED1 and R4.

**2\_Neopixel\_Blink.** Fit R6, R7 and D2. Fit L2, L3, L4. Fit LK3 in the VIN position. 
                                                          
**3\_LoRa\_Register\_Test.** Fit R12. Fit two x 10pin 0.1" socket headers and then plug in a LoRa module. Or if your going to fit a bare LoRa module drill the hole or cut the track to select the correct antenna.  Solder the bare LoRa module in place. Make sure you have an antenna connected.    

**4\_LoRa\_Transmitter.** No extra components needed at this stage. **Make sure you have an antenna connected.**

**5\_LoRa\_Receiver.** No extra components needed at this stage. **Make sure you have an antenna connected.**
                                                      
**6\_MMC\_SD\_Test.** Fit R10, R11, R16, R17, R18.

**7\_SSD1306\_SH1106\_OLED\_Checker.** Fit LK6, LK7 as appropriate for the OLED your using. There are mounting holes on the EasyBoardESP32 if you want to secure the display in place with M2 screws and spacers. 
  
**8\_I2C\_Scanner.** No extra components needed at this stage.
                                                      
**9\_BME280\_Test.** Fit COND.

**10\_I2C\_FRAM\_Memory\_Test.** Fit R8, R9 and IC2.

**11\_MPR121\_3X4\_Keypad\_Test.** Fit CONC.

**12\_VIN\_Voltage\_Read\_Test.** Fit R1 and R2.
                                             
**13\_GPS\_Echo Fit R14 and R15.** Fit CONB.

**14\_GPS\_Checker\_With\_Display.** No extra components needed at this stage. If there is no output from the GPS, check its wired OK and connected correctly. If the GPS does not get a fix then its either faulty or is being used in a poor reception area such as indoors. There is no magic voodoo program that will make GPS work in these conditions.  

**15\_Switch\_Test.** Fit R3 and R5. Fit SW1, SW2, SW3.
                                                       
**16\_LoRa\_Packet\_Logger\_With\_Display.** No extra components needed at this stage.                                  

**17\_MMC\_SDfile\_Transfer\_Transmitter**  No extra components needed at this stage. Do copy the files; $50SATL.JPG, $50SATS.JPG, $50SATT.JPG, testfile.txt to the SD card on a PC so the program has something to transfer.
  
**18\_MMC\_SDfile\_Transfer\_Receiver** No extra components needed at this stage.

**19\_ArduCAM\_Capture2MMC** You need to add the ArduCAM. This example uses an OV2640. It was connected to the Mikrobus socket on a board that had a RFM95 LoRa device fitted on the board. The UART TX pin on the Mikrobus socket was used as the CS for the OV2640. Note you will need to install the ArduCAM ESP32S UNO core in the Arduino IDE, this core is not compatible with previous ArduCAM libraries, so they will probably need to be deleted.

</p>

<br>



**20\_ArduCAM\_Image\_Transfer**  No extra components needed at this stage.
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Adding external power supply
The following components are needed if you want to power the Neopixels from a connected battery. The Neopixels need 5V and the battery could be more than that so a 5V regulator is needed. Fit BAT1 screw terminal. Fit D1, FS1 and SW5. Fit C4, C5, C6 and C7. Fit REGA. Put LK3 in 5V position. Add batteries. 


## Gerber files and Support

Its possible that at some time in the future I will sell these PCBs, but for now you can use the Gerber files included here to get your own boards made. Note the Gerber files have the original name for the board; NodeMCUShieldBasicWithLoRa.

[**EasyBuild ESP32 Repository**](https://github.com/StuartsProjects/Devices/tree/master/EasyBuildESP32 "EasyBuild ESP32 Repository")

The only condition of use for these files is that you do not get the boards made and sell them on to others. 

Also appreciate that I cannot provide support for using this board for applications other than the programs in the \examples folder. If the examples don't work for you its most likely you have a build or part error.
