The Arduino library I was working on for the SX1280 has had a couple of flights running a high altitude balloon tracker, and the tracker transmitter and receiver both worked. The contents of this library have been transferred to the SX12XX library available for download here;

Its only been used by myself so far, so test any applications you use it for carefully. The ranging function needs some further investigation, I have seen some instances of invalid results returned.
