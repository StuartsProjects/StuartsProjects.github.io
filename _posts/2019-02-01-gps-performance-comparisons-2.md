I have carried out a performance review of the common available GPSs that you might use for a LoRaÂ® tracker.

In most cases you will run the GPS in hot fix mode, and unfortunately most of the common GPS breakout boards that you get on eBay etc, are not suited for this in a power miser tracker that needs to survive on batteries for a month or longer. The reasons are explained in the article.

There is data of the performance of 12 common GPSs, signal strength (antenna effectiveness), real world power consumption and hot fix performance over an extended period. There are notes on methods of reducing tracker power consumption.

Choose the wrong GPS and your tracker, powered by a 2800mAhr battery, might only last 14 days. Choose the GPS wisely and the same battery can last 200 days.

The report is at the link below;
