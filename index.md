This is my new website for publishing information on the projects I get involved in, mostly to do with exploring the capabilities and applications for devices with LoRa. This website is very much a work in progress. There will still be products available to purchase, but in future this will be from the Tindie market place, selling from there makes it much easier to provide a secure shop. 

Although the Jekyll them in use here (minima) is fairly basic at the moment, the Jekyll Github pages combination means its easy to work on a locally running copy of the website and then just push the changes up to the live Github pages repository. 

I will be migrating the previous blog posts to this site. It will probably take a few weeks before that task is completed. 

Meanwhile if you have questions or issues with products I have supplied in the past you can contact me on a new email address; stuart at stuartsprojects add dot com on the end.
