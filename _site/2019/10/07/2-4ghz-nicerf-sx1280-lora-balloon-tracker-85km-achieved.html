    <p>I have had the basic send and transmit function of my Arduino Library for the SX1280 working for a couple of months, but I was keen to subject the code to a real World test before publishing it. So I built a small GPS tracker (25g) to use on a high altitude balloon.</p>

<p><img src="/images/word-image-768x576.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The SX1280 LoRa devices can calculate distance by measuring the time of flight of a special packet exchange, I wanted to see how far this ranging feature would work, I had previously tested it to 40km in a hilltop to hilltop test.</p>

<p>So I set about converting some balloon tracking code I had originally written for the SX127X LoRa device to use my SX1280 library. This software runs as a GPS tracker typically using an ATMega328P as on an Arduino Pro Mini. The receiver can also be powered by a Pro Mini, but to run the Micro SD data logging, display and receiver’s GPS requires a processor with more memory so I normally use a version of my LCD receiver that has an ATMega1284P processor.</p>

<p>Changing the code to run on the SX1280, including the remote control functions took a month or more and with it eventually working I added the SX1280 Ranging capability. For this function the remote balloon tracker would transmit a short command that the receiver identifies as a ranging request. The receiver then initiates the ranging packet exchange process and displays the results as a distance.</p>

<p>I eventually had a chance to test the tracker on the 22nd July, weather conditions looked suitable and the small tracker was fitted to a Qualatex 36” foil balloon and launched from the Black Rock picnic site between the two Severn bridges on the West side of the Severn.</p>

<p>I was not using the longest range mode of the SX1280, I chose a LoRa bandwidth of 406khz as I wanted to avoid potential issues if the tracker got very cold and the TX and RX became more than 25% of the bandwidth apart in frequency. Its possible that further work will show that the lower bandwidth of 203khz, which would give more distance capability, can be used. I am also looking at implementing an AFC capability in the software.</p>

<p>The balloon rose slower than expected and was moving horizontally quite quickly. A 2.4Ghz magnetic mounted antenna on my car’s roof was not receiving strong enough signals to be able to follow the pico in the car, so I stuck to tracking it from a playing field with a cheap Wi-Fi yagi.</p>

<p><img src="/images/word-image-1-768x1024-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The balloon rose to 7903m where it apparently burst and descended. I lost contact with it when it was at 3259m altitude and the <strong>GPS calculated distance was 85.325km, direction 57degrees</strong>. The ranging function measured the distance as 85.133km, so with ranging now known to work at that distance, the flight was a success.</p>

<p><img src="/images/word-image-2-768x576.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The point of lost contact was over the River Stour near Sutton-under-Brailes.</p>

<p>I hope within the next week or so to be able to send the 2.4Ghz LoRa tracker to around 30km altitude on a latex balloon launch.</p>

<p>The Arduino library seems to work well, with perhaps some improvements required in the ranging code and an AFC capability. I particular I need to write a note on how I carried out the necessary ranging calibration.</p>
