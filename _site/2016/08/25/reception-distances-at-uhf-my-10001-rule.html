    <p>I often get asked what range you can get in ‘typical conditions’ using LoRa. There is a simple answer;</p>

<p><em>“There is no such thing as typical conditions.”</em></p>

<p>On several occasions constructors have got in touch and said; “I am only getting 1KM, yet you are quoting hundreds of KM, what is wrong with my set-up?” The answer to that is also simple;</p>

<p><em>“There is probably nothing wrong”.</em></p>

<p>It is not commonly understood how much the range\distance of communications at UHF can vary. Of course most people expect a difference between an urban area and hilltop to hilltop, but the actual differences are often a surprise. Are the communications over flat or hilly terrain, in urban, rural or forest or perhaps ground to satellite or ground to high altitude balloon?</p>

<p>I was fortunate during the radio testing for the $50SAT project to be able to develop a real world rule of thumb. Whilst testing the Morse beacon (on 437Mhz) I wondered if cutting the transmit power between dits and dahs would make an audible difference, there was an advantage in doing so as it saved around 33% of the battery power.</p>

<p>So I set-up the $50SAT transmitter board running the Morse beacon in my garden and wandered away up the road with my Yaesu FT60 hand-held till the Morse beacon was only just audible above the background noise. This was at a distance of 1km. I live in an urban area and its relatively flat.</p>

<p>The very same $50SAT transmitter board was put into orbit in November 2013. Some months later I was walking into town (it was a nice day) and $50SAT passed at approx 1200km distance. I heard the Morse Beacon very clearly with my Yaesu FT60.</p>

<p>In an urban environment the limit of reception was 1km, yet with the exact same transmitter and receiver and clear line of sight, the reception distance was 1200km, probably more.</p>

<p>That is where my 1000:1 rule comes from.</p>

<p>Thus whilst you might get 400KM with LoRa from the ground to a high altitude balloon, do not be surprised if at ground level in a city you get 400M or less.</p>

<p>This difference is also why it is so difficult to compare reception at different locations. I might get 1KM in my locality, the same equipment might cover anywhere between 250M and 10KM+ elsewhere. The differences are a good reason to be clear about the conditions applying to a reception report, preferably with pictures of the area.</p>
