    <p>It’s helpful to know how good the LoRa signals you are receiving are, or perhaps more importantly how close the are to failure.</p>

<p>The LoRa device measures two things during packet reception, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measured in dBm, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) measured in dB.</p>

<p><strong>SNR</strong></p>

<p>From practical experiments I have observed that as the reported SNR approaches the limit specified for the spreading factor (SF8) then the packet reception will start to fail.</p>

<p>For instance at SF8 the SNR limit is -10dB. If your transmitting packets and they are being received at SNR of -0dB and you then reduce transmit power by 8 or 9dBm, the reported SNR will drop to around -9dB and packet reception starts to fail. I have found the reported SNR a very good indication of approaching reception failure.</p>

<p><strong>RSSI</strong></p>

<p>Under very good reception conditions, with strong signals, the reported SNR rarely goes above 8dB, even as signals get stronger. So for very strong signals SNR is not a good indicator of signal quality.</p>

<p>I decided to plot the results of a large variety of reception conditions, at SF7 bandwidth 125000hz. The signals varied from very strong, the transmitter and receiver close together, to very weak signals where packet reception was failing. I plotted the results, see the graph below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/SNR-versus-RSSI-Graph_thumb.jpg" alt="SNR versus RSSI Graph" title="SNR versus RSSI Graph" /></p>

<p>You can see the spread of reported RSSI for SNRs of 10,9 and 8, the range is -45dBm to -105dBm. So clearly SNR is not a lot of help for giving a quality indication for very strong signals.</p>

<p>But then look what happens as the SNR drops, at the failure point, -8dB SNR and below, the RSSI varies from -100dBm to -120dBm.</p>

<p>For an overall quality indicator, perhaps a compromise is needed. If the SNR is say 7dB or higher, use the RSSI figure, and if SNR is lower than 7dB, use the SNR.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
